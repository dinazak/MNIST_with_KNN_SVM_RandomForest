# MNIST_with_KNN_SVM_RandomForest

# Dataset description: 
The MNIST dataset is an acronym that stands for the Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology dataset. It is a dataset of 60,000 small square 28Ã—28 pixel grayscale images of handwritten single digits between 0 and 9

# Feature extraction: 
Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) is applied to extract features from the dataset, which focuses on the structure or the shape of an object.

# Classifiers:
- K-neighrest neighbors (KNN): It is used for classification and regression. The input consists of the k closest training examples in a data set (non_param method) 
- Support vector machines (SVM): Are a set of supervised learning methods used for classification, regression and outliers detection (Effective in high dimensional         spaces) 
- Random Forest: fits a number of decision tree classifiers on various sub-samples of the dataset and uses averaging to improve the predictive accuracy and control over-   fitting.
